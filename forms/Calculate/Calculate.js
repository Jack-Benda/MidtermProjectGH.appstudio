/*Create a function named calcAvgSquare to calculate the average times the square of the first number. The formula is: 
       ((num1 + num2 + num3)/3) * num12
The function must have 3 parameters.
The function must return the answer to the main program.
All input from the user and output to the user must occur in the main program, not the function.  
> Get numbers from the user in the main program.
> Output the answer using an alert (with a template literal) to the user from the main program.

Num2 = Number(prompt("Enter the second number"))
Num3 = Number(prompt("Enter the third number"))
